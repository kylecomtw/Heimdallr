# Heimdallr
A chart parser for hand written syntax rules in Chinese

It is named after god guarding rainbow bridge Bifr√∂st in Norse mythology, 
for which the chart parser generated series of "arc" that resembles a rainbow bridge.

The codes were written in C++/14, and most of them are written in 2016. This project 
belongs to a greater endeavor of Coeus, which at the time aimed to provide a rethink-through solution for Chinese NLP.
Coeus project consists of M3Seg, a maximal-matching segmentator, which implements lexicon/heuristic-based word segmentation algorithm; 
Heimdallr, which handles syntax parsing; Muse, which provides lexical semantics through LDA; 
Mnemosyne, which interfaces with wikipedia to provide world knowledge.
